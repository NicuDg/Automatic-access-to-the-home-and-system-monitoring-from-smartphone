# Automatic-access-to-the-home-and-system-monitoring-from-smartphone
  The Arduino platform was used to automate the access, and an Android application will communicate with the system via the Internet.
  
  The system can be controlled and monitored from an Android application via the internet, the server is on the Arduino board. 
It can also work automatically by identifying the car using GPS coordinates. Three infrared sensors, three servomotors, 
one passive infrared sensor, one RFID module were used to automate the system, all being wired to the Arduino board.
